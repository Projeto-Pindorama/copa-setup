# Teiú
The really tiny² installation system for Copacabana Linux.

## What is the main idea?
This is meant to be an installation system/wizard for Copacabana Linux.  
No, don't confuse it with the UCB `install`(8) utility, they're not related at
all — `install`(8) is meant for installing binaries in a more portable and
automatized way, while Teiú is meant for installing a system, a set of
tarballs, in a disk.  
This is more like an equivalent to the `void-installer`(1) script present at
Void Linux, for instance; but simpler, *a whole lot simpler <sup>(and
hackable/readable)</sup>* than it.  

## Features? (And why not Calamares?)

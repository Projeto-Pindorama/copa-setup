# Teiú
The really tiny² installation system for Copacabana Linux.

## What is the main idea?
This is meant to be an installation system/wizard for Copacabana Linux.  
No, don't confuse it with the UCB `install`(8) utility nor with the `pkgadd`(8)
utility (which installs packages), they're not related at all — `install`(8) is
meant for installing binaries in a more portable and automatized way, while Teiú
is meant for installing a system, a set of tarballs, in a disk; and `pkgadd`(8)
is meant to install packages in an already installed system, transfering
contents to the system or just plain extracting them in the file system tree and
configuring the system to use them with scripts. If you're looking for a package
manager, you're may looking for
[Motoko](https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/motoko)...<sup>Which at this time don't have a single line of code, but already have a plan</sup>.  
This is more like an equivalent to the `void-installer`(1) script present at
Void Linux, for instance; but simpler, *a whole lot simpler <sup>(and
hackable/readable)</sup>* than it.  

## Features? (And why not Calamares?)
